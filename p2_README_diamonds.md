1. INTRODUCTION:

This file contains the source informations about the classic dataset that contains the prices and other attributes of almost 
54,000 diamonds. It's a great dataset for beginners learning how to work with data analysis/visualization and machine learning 
algorithms.

2. PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:

This code was made on R, which is a language that is not entirely unlike (versions 3 and 4 of) the S language developed at AT&T 
Bell Laboratories by Rick Becker, John Chambers and Allan Wilks.

R is free software distributed under a GNU-style copyleft.
The core of R is an interpreted computer language with a syntax superficially similar to C, but which is actually a "functional
programming language" with capabilities similar to Scheme.  The language allows branching and looping as well as modular programming
using functions.

3. ABOUT THE DATASET:

'A data frame with 53940 rows and 10 variables:

- CARAT - Weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)
{ A metric “carat” is defined as 200 milligrams. Each carat is subdivided into 100 points. }

- CUT - Quality of the Cut in increasing order: Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal

- COLOR - Diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)

- CLARITY - A measurement of how clear the diamond is: I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best)

- DEPTH: The height of a diamond, measured from the culet to the table, divided by its average girdle diameter
{ Depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79) }

- TABLE: Width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)

- PRICE: price in US dollars (\$326 -- \$18,823)
~ 4C's - 

- X: length in mm (0--10.74)

- Y: width in mm (0--58.9)

- Z: depth in mm (0--31.8)'
